1. List All Books Issued by a Specific Member
This query shows all the books issued by a specific member, including the member's name, book title, and issue date.

SELECT M.Name AS MemberName, B.Title AS BookTitle, IB.IssueDate, IB.ReturnDate, IB.Returned
FROM IssuedBooks IB
JOIN Members M ON IB.MemberID = M.MemberID
JOIN Books B ON IB.BookID = B.BookID
WHERE M.Name = 'John Doe';
Advanced Feature: This query involves JOIN operations between the Members, Books, and IssuedBooks tables, along with a filtering condition for a specific member.
2. List Overdue Books and Fines
This query lists all books that are overdue for return. You can also calculate fines based on the number of overdue days ($1 per day).

SELECT M.Name AS MemberName, B.Title AS BookTitle, IB.IssueDate, IB.ReturnDate, DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, IB.ReturnDate) AS DaysOverdue,
       CASE 
           WHEN DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, IB.ReturnDate) > 0 THEN DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, IB.ReturnDate) * 1
           ELSE 0
       END AS FineAmount
FROM IssuedBooks IB
JOIN Members M ON IB.MemberID = M.MemberID
JOIN Books B ON IB.BookID = B.BookID
WHERE IB.Returned = 0 AND IB.ReturnDate < CURRENT_DATE;
Advanced Feature: Use of DATEDIFF() to calculate overdue days and a CASE statement to compute fines.
3. Most Popular Books (Books Issued the Most)
This query retrieves the top books based on the number of times they've been issued.
SELECT B.Title, COUNT(IB.IssueID) AS TimesIssued
FROM IssuedBooks IB
JOIN Books B ON IB.BookID = B.BookID
GROUP BY B.BookID
ORDER BY TimesIssued DESC
LIMIT 5;
Advanced Feature: This query uses GROUP BY and COUNT() to aggregate data, along with ORDER BY and LIMIT to get the top results.
4. List Members Who Have Not Returned Books
This query lists members who have books that are still issued (i.e., not returned).

SELECT M.Name, M.Email, B.Title, IB.IssueDate, IB.ReturnDate
FROM IssuedBooks IB
JOIN Members M ON IB.MemberID = M.MemberID
JOIN Books B ON IB.BookID = B.BookID
WHERE IB.Returned = 0;
Advanced Feature: This query includes a condition that filters records based on the Returned status.
5. Books Availability Status
This query provides a report showing each book's availability status, including the number of copies available and the total number of copies.

SELECT B.Title, B.Copies, B.AvailableCopies, 
    CASE 
        WHEN B.AvailableCopies > 0 THEN 'Available'
        ELSE 'Not Available'
    END AS AvailabilityStatus
FROM Books B;
