The Library Management System (LMS) automates library operations, including book management, member registration, and book transactions (issuing and returning). Key features include:
Book Management: Add, update, remove books, and track availability.
Member Management: Register, update, and track members.
Book Transactions: Issue books, track due dates, return books, and update availability.
Search & Reporting: Search books by title, author, or category, view overdue books, and generate transaction reports.
MySQL is used for data storage with queries like INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, and JOIN. Primary and foreign keys ensure data integrity, with data types like INT, VARCHAR, DATE, and BOOLEAN for different fields.
